            O'Reilly, 1999
    
    Synopsis:
        rename.py [options] <pattern> <replacement> [<file1> ... <fileN>]
    
        Options:
            --help  This help documentations.
            --doit  Rename files. The default behaviour is to print what
                    would be done.
    
    Examples:
    
        # Print what would be done to rename all avi files to just show name and episode string.
        rename.py '.*(S\d\dE\d\d).*' 'Quantico - \1.avi' *.avi
    
        # Perform the rename.
        rename.py '.*(S\d\dE\d\d).*' 'Quantico - \1.avi' *.avi --doit
